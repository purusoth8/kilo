        <h4 class="m-sm-5 m-1 content-section" style="font-weight: 700;">Kilo Biryani is prepared in an earthen pot called Handi, the rice and meat are layered, bottom and top layer are always rice. An interlayer of some condiments is introduced between the meat and the rice. Hyderabadi Biryani is the kachay gosht
            ki Biryani or the dum Biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. Lucknowni or Awadhi Biryani is a pakki Biryani. The rice and meat are generally
            partially cooked separately in spiced water, then layered and cooked by the dum pukht method. Kolkata Biryani is much lighter on spices and uses potato & egg to enhance its flavour. It is a sub variant of Lucknowi style of Biryani. Kilo Biriyani
            uses one of the most expensive branded rice, stringently selected meat pieces and vegetables, Kerala carefully sourced spices, authentic age old recipes to make its Biryani. On top of it, Kilo Biryani is cooked individually & fresh in the
            same Handi as it is served to you.</h4>

At Kilo Biriyani, The Korma is made
            by marinating the main ingredients in yoghurt, cashew paste and fresh ground spices to produce a mouth-watering thick sauce or glaze. We believe that Kilo serves the best mutton, chicken & veg kormas in the country.</h4>

<h4 class="m-sm-5 m-1 content-section" style="font-weight: 700;text-align: center;">At Kilo Biriyani we strive towards inclusive growth & environment friendly approach. We work closely with potters at Kumhaara Gram on the outskirts of Colombo to develop our hand made pots/handi's for our biryanis. We cut across the middlemen and ensure
    that the potters get their due share of the efforts. Also Kilo Biryanis are cooked in the same Handi's in which they are delivered, ensuring best freshness & hygiene. Kilo Biriyani Handi's are reusable for cooking or putting plants, painting etc.
    All this brings back to our roots & sustainable development. Let us all work toward better ecosystem by being more conscious towards our environment & people. Kilo Biriyani Pot provide lot of health aspect while we cooked and you eat. Better health
    for better life tomorrow.</h4>
